## Abstract

**Background:** Accurate estimation of gestational age and expected date of delivery is essential in obstetric practice. In Nepal, clinical documentation commonly utilizes the Bikram Sambat (B.S.) calendar, creating practical challenges when performing obstetric date calculations manually.

**Objective:** To develop a lightweight, accessible, and clinically practical obstetric calculator capable of determining Estimated Date of Delivery (EDD) and Period of Gestation (POG) using LMP entered in the Nepali (B.S.) date system.

**Methods:** The calculator applies standard obstetric dating principles (Naegele’s rule: LMP + 280 days) and computes gestational age relative to the current date. The application is built using web technologies (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) and deployed as a Progressive Web App (PWA) to enable offline functionality on Android devices.

**Results:** The tool provides rapid and reliable obstetric date calculations using the Nepali calendar, reducing manual calculation errors and improving efficiency in outpatient, inpatient, and primary care settings.

**Conclusion:** This application offers a practical digital solution for obstetric date calculation within the Nepali healthcare system and may support improved workflow efficiency in clinical practice.
